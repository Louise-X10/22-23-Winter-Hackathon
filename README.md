# 22-23 Winter Hackathon

- `bouncing-balls`: Bouncing balls web simulation with self-implemented physics
- `compound-interest`: Compount Interest Calculator
- `poker`: Texas hold'em poker game (currently single-player only)

## Bouncing balls
25 balls of random size, color, velocity are created. Use `AWSD` to move the Evilball (transparent with white border) and eat the other balls. A total ball count is kept on the upper right corner of the page. 

P.S. When two balls collide, they bounce off each other and both change to another random color. 

## Compound interest calculator
Calculator with 4 input fields: primary amount, interest rate, time cycle, final amount. Given any 3 of the 4 fields, the calculator can compute the remaining field. More detailed instructions are given on the webpage. 

## Online two-player Poker (Playable)

  - NEW: Break ties with more than 2 players
- What happens if player disconnects
  - During game, player that disconnects and reconnects with same name should be able to rejoin game with same socket?
  - Pause game if someone disconnects, save game session info, reload game once reconnect
  - Notify someone has disconnected, press reset button to reset new game
- Online multi-user version with Socket.io
  - Client's ability:

    - Make bet and animate token movement to common table
    - Collect tokens and animate token movement to player table (not done)
